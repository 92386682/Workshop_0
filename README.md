Basic animation involving a simple loop of 3 variables moving across the screen, causing transparent squares to overlap. 

To begin with a simple illustration constructed In javascript via p5.s
Beginning with simple illustrations, I eventually led into creating a work that utilized the transparency and animation capabilities of the medium and was inspired visually by simple lattice weaving patterns.

  Constructed entirely by alternating rectangles, each with transparency, each link then was animated to move vertically or horizontally. It was only necessary to move one “link” down to create a seamless loop.

The basic movement were very simple var ++ statements, with varying negative or positive modifiers  

``x = x - 1;
y = y + 1;
z = z - 1;
BO = BO + 1;``

with x, y, z and BO all being variables determining the x/y coordinates of the squares themselves.

That said, I ended up simplifying this down to squares rather than rectangles, as the geometry of rectangles was difficult without overcomplicating variables (as it would require morphing the size of each rectangle to fit with orientation, as well as the x/y values for movement.

Whilst trying to loop the animation, I was forced to read further into comparison operators, and using negative variables.
